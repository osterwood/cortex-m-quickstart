# `cortex-m-quickstart`

> A template for building applications for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers

## Dependencies

To build embedded programs using this template you'll need:

- Rust 1.31, 1.30-beta, nightly-2018-09-13 or a newer toolchain. e.g. `rustup
  default beta`

- The `cargo generate` subcommand. [Installation
  instructions](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate#installation).

- `rust-std` components (pre-compiled `core` crate) for the ARM Cortex-M
  targets. Run:

``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi thumbv7m-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Using this template

1. Instantiate the template.

``` console
$ git clone https://github.com/osterwood/cortex-m-quickstart app
$ cd app
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set a default compilation target. 

``` console
$ invoke target MCUNAME
```
This will setup the appropiate options in `.cargo/config` and layout in `memory.x`.  The devices.yml holds data which feeds these files.

3. Build the template application or one of the examples.

``` console
$ invoke run blink
```
